# TabManager
A plugin used to create custom TAB lists for commands that do not support them.

## What is a TAB list?
A tab list or an executor is called whenever someone presses the LIST PLAYERS button on a command that supports
tab executors. Tab Executors can be specific to permission, player, argument length, world, etc.

### How it Works
Spoiler: it doesn't. At least not yet.

### How it will Works
TabManager will work almost exclusively based off of configs, but will have a command to change values in those configs.
